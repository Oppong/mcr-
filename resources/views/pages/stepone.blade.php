        <p class="">This short article is one of six series under the topic: <em> <strong> Step-By-Step Entry into the World of the Entrepreneur. </strong></em>
           Its objective is to encourage people to pursue financial knowledge as a primary step into the world
           of entrepreneur. One of the awareness often created in entrepreneurship presentations is that, getting
            a business idea first is of primary importance to a prospective entrepreneur than the money to start it.
             Among others, getting a business idea first provides good basis for estimating how much you would need,
             determining where to source for funding and justifying the need to the financier(s) which can be a friend(s),
              parent(s), money lender(s) or from one’s personal investment(s). However, this must not rule out the
               importance of having some basic financial knowledge. After all, the ultimate goal of entrepreneurship
               is generally to create wealth, which has the bigger economic picture than just the money needed to
                start a business. Financial knowledge is critical at all times-before, during and after establishing
                a business. </p> <br>

<p>Ideally, a prospective entrepreneur must have some basic financial knowledge -
  personal finances and management behaviour, the constituents of finance and the
  financial sector products, opportunities and basic issues worth noting – savings,
  investment, lending, financial instruments and others. Such worth of knowledge and
  mindfulness for instance enable a person, such as a student, a jobless or an employee
  to establish strategic relationships with individuals and entities far before the time
  he/she ventures into entrepreneurship and have to access credit and other opportunities. </p> <br>

<p>Acquiring basic financial knowledge can start from personal conduct of financial inventory through
  completion of worksheets such as below (downloadable version attached as Appendix ‘A’):</p> <br>


<h6 class="font-weight-bold text-center"> FINANCIAL INVENTORY WORKSHEET </h6>
<p>Name:……………………………………………………………………………………………………….</p>
<p>Employment/Business Status:…..………………………………………………………………………</p>
<p>Children/Child:………………………………………………………………………………...................</p>
<p> <u>Dependents</u> </p>
<p>Do you have a family member(s) that are financially dependent upon you or could be in the
  future? (i.e. parents, grandparents, siblings, etc.)  Yes……………..No…………………………..</p>

<p> <u> <strong> Monthly Income </strong> </u> </p>
<p>How much do you earn monthly?.................................................................................................</p>
<ol>
  <li>Salary or from business earnings……………..………………………………………………</li>
  <li>Allowance………………………………………………………………………………………….</li>
  <li>Pocket money from parents/relative, etc.)……………………………………………………</li>
  <li>Others………………………………………………………………………………………………</li>
</ol>
<p> <strong>Total = $……………………</strong> </p>

<p> <u> <strong> Monthly Expenditure  </strong> </u> </p>
<p>How much do you spend monthly?................................................................................................</p>
<ol>
  <li>Rent…………………………………………………………………………………………………</li>
  <li>Utilities…………………………………………………………………………………………….</li>
  <li>Transportation……………………………………………………………………………………</li>
  <li>Repairs……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Groceries……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Food Outside Home……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Food at Home……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Clothing……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Cleaning……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Cosmetics……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Church support……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Entertainment……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Health Care……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Gift……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Dependents……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
  <li>Others (you may add more)……………………………………………………………………………………………..</li>
</ol>

<p> <strong>Total = $……………………</strong> </p>

<p> <strong>Net Income</strong>  (Monthly Income – Monthly Expenditure) <strong> $ </strong> ……………………...</p>

<br>

<h6 class="font-weight-bold text-center"> Financial inventory exercise </h6>
<p>The exercise is not to be done by only people who earn income. Whether one is earning income or not,
  he/she must complete it. You would realize that, one of the importance of
  financial inventory exercise is its potential for prompting people to create business. </p>

  <p>The result of the inventory will indicate either positive or negative net income (i.e. income minus expenditure).
    The following questions would then be answered to give relevance to the exercise:</p>

  <ol>
    <li>Do you have a positive net income? If yes, what do you do with it?</li>
    <li>Do you have a negative net income? If yes, how do you fill this gap?</li>
    <li>Have you done such an exercise about your finances before?</li>
    <li>What have you learned from this exercise?</li>
    <li>What expenditure items do you find relevant or otherwise to maintain or introduce or delete?</li>
    <li>Do you need to change your financial management practices/lifestyle?</li>
  </ol>

<br>

<p>In all the surveys conducted with this inventory worksheet at the Author’s presentations
   (seminars and the like), over 90% of participants obtain negative net income.
   They mostly include students, jobless, petty traders (table-top traders) and
    small scale enterprises (SMEs) owners. There are instances where some people
    shed tears for realizing that, they could have gathered enough to go into business,
    get out of debt or improve their businesses long ago if they had disciplined themselves
    financially a little. </p>

    <br>

    <p>
      You will recall Scarborough’s assertion that ‘Many people come out with great ideas but most
      of them never act on them’ Scarborough (2013). It has been found from discussions at our
      seminars that, if students, the jobless and the masses would be educated in personal
      financial management as an initial critical step to go into the world of entrepreneur,
      this abandonment of great business ideas will be appreciably addressed. Going into business
      with one’s own fund/capital or interest-free loan is mostly the preferred option in some
      socio-cultural environments. We therefore strongly recommend that, topics treated at entrepreneurship
       seminars and the like include ‘acquisition of basic financial management knowledge’ as a critical module
        of primary concern in entrepreneurship.

    <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-center"> Factors accounting for financial indiscipline </h6>
    <p>We have also identified the following as some of the factors accounting for financial indiscipline.
      They may help those who complete the inventory worksheet to review their results for the needed
      change in their financial management practices/lifestyle or behaviour.</p>

    <ol type="i">
        <li>No financial plan just as there may be no life plans.</li>
        <li>Haphazard spending</li>
        <li>Unnecessary purchases</li>
        <li>Unbudgeted for financial commitments.</li>
        <li>Disregard for lower currency denominations</li>
        <li>Disregard for value for money considerations in purchases.</li>
        <li>Excessive accumulation of wealth in clothing/unproductive things.</li>
        <li>Lack of knowledge about where to invest. </li>
        <li>Lack of knowledge about how to invest.</li>
        <li>No conscious periodic review of personal finances. </li>
        <li>No separation between personal and business finances.</li>
        <li>Feeding the monkeys. Guess what? </li>
    </ol>

    <br>

    <h6 class="font-weight-bold text-center"> Good habit to cultivate  </h6>

      <li>Windfall/Donations</li>
    </ul>


<p> <u> <strong>Acquiring</strong> </u> the funds after careful consideration of the identified sources. </p>
<ul>
  <li>What specific thing(s) do I need the money for?</li>
  <li>Which source do I choose and why?</li>
  <li>What is the best arrangement or conditions for this fund?</li>
  <li>What payment plan do I have?</li>
  <li>Note: Do not borrow money or access a loan if you do not have a specific <br>
     need for it, even if it is interest free, and a plan for the payment.</li>
  <li>Etc.</li>
</ul>

<p> <u> <strong>Allocating,</strong> </u> spending or using your money according to a financial plan (e.g. budget).  </p>
<ul>
  <li>Self–clothing, food, shelter, etc.</li>
  <li>Education/School fees</li>
  <li>Business</li>
  <li>Home/Family</li>
  <li>Poor & Needy </li>
  <li>Church</li>
</ul>


<p> <u> <strong>Monitor & Evaluate </strong> </u> your spending, debt servicing and other financial considerations. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Pay yourself (1).</li>
  <li>Pay your business (2), if applicable.</li>
  <li>Have a reserve money/fund (3).</li>
  <li>Save and Invest (4) – Treasury bill, fixed deposit, managed fund, etc.     </li>
  <li>Live within your means – Cut your coat according to your material. Note: <br>
     Not according to your size as it is normally said. </li>
  <li>Check periodically whether present and future needs are being met as planned. </li>
</ul>

<p> <strong>Note:</strong>  The best way to do many things is to do one thing at a time. </p>

<br>

<h6 class="font-weight-bold text-center"> Care to know about the financial sector  </h6>
<p>Prospective entrepreneurs must care about having some basic knowledge about their Country’s
  financial sector – Bank and non-bank financial institutions, fund management institutions, the
  stock market, payment systems, interest rates, treasury bills, fixed deposits, financial regulators,
  licensing issues (legal and illegal operators) and many more. There are a lot of information which one can obtain with a little effort. </p>

<br>

<p>
  We have found that, a good number of people lack knowledge about financial matters and their related institutions. This situation has potential for some people becoming victims of illegal financial operators and high cost of financing business as starters, particularly when there are unfortunate information failures on the part of state institutions. Generally, it is possible for one to just walk to financial institutions and collect brochures about financial products, just to educate him/herself even before becoming an entrepreneur. The websites of the institutions, the central banks and other financial sector regulators can also be of great help. The daily print and electronic news also have a lot to offer but some people pay less or no attention to them. They even change stations or switch off their television and radio sets when it comes to financial news items. Likewise, they flip over the financial news pages of newspapers and also do not see the need to read or buy dedicated financial newspapers.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  There are many other issues to talk about but we would touch just one more finding. This is about opening and operating a bank account as a prospective entrepreneur. A number of people testify that, their mere having of a bank account encouraged their relatives and financiers to offer them money. In most cases, financial sources make it a requirement for one to open a bank account before they give the money, be it the banks, the uncles, brothers and sisters. It would therefore be better for prospective entrepreneurs to have knowledge about account opening and operations. This knowledge will facilitate their future company account opening and operation.
</p>

<br>

<p>
  It is hoped that, the primary importance of acquiring basic financial knowledge as one enters the world of the entrepreneur would be appreciated upon the little said in this article
